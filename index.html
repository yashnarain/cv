    <li><strong>Cornell University</strong></li>
    <p>Summer College, Computer Science<br>Grade: SX<br>Jun 2019 – July 2019<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11GBhne8v5BwxKBWJC44AMdS1zkOsk_ar/view?usp=drive_open">Letter & Transcript</a></p>
    <p>
      I spent the summer at Cornell University, engaging in conversations on Fabricating the Future with AI and Robotics. There, I was not only introduced to robotics and communication over wireless networks, but also realised the expansive breadth
      of CS through my interactions with professors and a global network of peers. I also visited Cornell’s cutting edge research facility- the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). I was introduced to Arduino Programming, LEDs - M5 Stack,
      Servos, Motors, Microcontrollers, Logical Programming and Python. The best part was the hands on building aspect of the course, which instilled in me the confidence to become an innovator and a creator.

    <p>Amity University<br>May 2019 - Jul 2019<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DH3LLjae1AYfPzr2lIxFeRpC9VGYPRya/view">Project Report</a></p>
    <p>
      Assisting a senior in his bachelor’s these, I combined Life Sciences with Machine Learning in order to create an efficient autonomous system that predicted the probability of a person suffering from a heart disease. The web application was made
      using Flask, which is a Python Framework for developing web applications. The application takes the parameters of the data as input through a form from the user. On pressing the predict button, the page shows the prediction – “Yes” or “No”.

    <li><strong>High School Summer Trainee</strong></li>
    <p>Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi<br>Feb 2019 - Mar 2019<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14D_7vKzOmlS0UD_YykndcxY1wQs9-FAT/view?usp=drive_open">Certificates</a></p>
    <p>
      Tryst is the annual technical festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, held in February and March. The festival is the largest technical festival in North India, with an attendance of more than 60,000 people. Competitive events,
      guest lectures, technical workshops, and exhibitions all take place at the festival.<br><br>All the Summer Training Programs are Project Oriented Programs i.e. the content is covered practically with concepts of theoretical knowledge. After the
      competitive application round, I was selected to participate several workshops on Computer Science under eminent professors and explored the various cutting-edge laboratories.

    <li><strong>Organisation Head & Tech Secretary</strong></li>
    <p>La Martiniere Extracurricular Organisation<br>Apr 2018 - Apr 2020<br></p>
    <p>
      As the Organisation Head, I leveraged my leadership skills to manage a team of over three hundred volunteers to organize ‘Constantia’ - our annual cultural and academic fest. As the tech secretary, I headed the entire technical management team
      for the event. Tasks included setting up committees, appointing staff supervisors, managing score tabulation, and ensuring the success of our prestigious fest.<br><br>Throughout the year, I organised workshops where senior students introduced
      junior members to concepts ranging from VBA programming to computational theory and helped them develop practical programming skills.

    <li><strong>Space-based Solar Power</strong></li>
    <p>Independent Inter-disciplinary Research<br>Apr 2018 – Jul 2018<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bB-QruE-9Ap6qhUiffMqvxQoPCEWTUg/view">Research Report</a></p>
    <p>
      With this research, I explored the concept of Space based solar power panels. By putting solar panels in geosynchronous orbit, we can convert the incoming solar energy into radio frequency and transmit it to earth with pinpoint accuracy. While
      regular solar panels are helpful, they are not worth it due to their low productivity and high costs. However, Space based panels can provide 24 hour productivity since it is unaffected by barriers of solar radiation. It is safer, cheaper and
      the newest and the most effective way to supply for the need of renewable sources of energy.

    <p>India Story<br>Feb 2018 - Feb 2020<br><a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/india-story/id1473981712">India Story App</a></p>
    <p>
      India Story is a one of a kind app that draws on this ancient art of storytelling to highlight the past of a country as diverse as India. India Story handholds tourists through their journey of exploration of a city, using interactive audio
      guides to ensure that all those that travel in India feel the touch of its magic.<br><br>Hailing from the culturally rich town of Lucknow, in the province of Awadh, I treated the tourists with insights into the historic culture and glorious
      past of my hometown. I worked on the content for the audio guides and tried to give the listeners an immersive experience through wholesome and multi-faceted writing. I also collaborated with a peer for the photography of these heritage sites.

    <p>Tabeer-e-awadh<br>Feb 2017 - Feb 2020<br><a href="https://yashnarainagarwal.wixsite.com/tabeer-e-awadh">Journal</a></p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the rich legacy of Awadh, I translated my experience in India Story to create a journal on my hometown. Writing thoughtful and diverse content, I envisioned to give the readers an immersive experience through my writing. I
      collaborated with my school’s Junior Historians club and Photography club to give juniors a chance to explore the historic glory of Lucknow with engaging site visits and heritage photography.
    </p>

    <li><strong>Editor-in-chief</strong></li>
    <p>Constantia Editorial Board<br>Apr 2016 – Jan 2020<br></p>
    <p>
      Through India Story and Tabeer-e-awadh, I gained a nuanced understanding of professional writing and inspired several juniors to explore their creative side through this art. For my commitment to the prestigious School Editorial Board, my
      countless efforts on revolutionising the annual college magazine, ‘Constantia’, and incrementing the Board Membership by 100+ students, I was selected as the Editor-in-chief for two consecutive years.
